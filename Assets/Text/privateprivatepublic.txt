The public school you are attending is not at all like the public school your
friends attend. Firstly of all, there is no Science Olympiad. Your dreams have
been shattered. Secondly, the teachers are almost just as incompetent as the
teachers in private school. They constantly complain about how they are underpaid
by the district even though some teachers have the potential to teach at the worldâ€™s
most prestigious universities. You are informed by your philosophy teacher that
your school is suffering because of the school voucher system: The funds that
were used to support your old school were diverted away from your current school
during a time when it was already struggling to become financially viable. Just
yesterday, a stall collapsed while you were on the can. It was humiliating.
