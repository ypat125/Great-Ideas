School is all but bearable. Each day is a cycle of tedious work and uninteresting
information. The cafeteria food may be good, but the teachers don’t know how to
teach and your talents aren’t being put into good use. You asked your mother about
this, but she dismissed your allegations and said that private schools received
adequate funding, especially after the introduction of the school voucher program,
and therefore provide the best quality of education in the city. Meanwhile, your
friends attending a public school in Ohio are having the time of their lives.
Just last year, they traveled to Nashville for a national Science Olympiad
tournament and placed 2nd in the nation. Although your private school has more
funding than their school, your level of education is not at all comparable to
theirs.
